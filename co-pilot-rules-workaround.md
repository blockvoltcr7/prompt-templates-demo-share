**Cursor & Windsurf – Built-in Rules:** Modern AI coding IDEs like *Cursor* and *Windsurf* let you define project-specific **rules files** that guide the AI. For example, Cursor lets you put Markdown Cursor files (.mdc) in a .cursor/rules/ folder to tailor suggestions to your style or framework . Windsurf’s Cascade agent similarly supports global and workspace rules (e.g. a .windsurfrules file or .windsurf/rules/ directory) to override defaults with project-specific instructions . This means teams can write multiple rule files (e.g. coding standards, test conventions) that the AI will always consider when coding in those editors.

**Copilot’s Single Instruction File:** In contrast, GitHub Copilot (in VS Code or other IDEs) historically did **not** support a whole directory of rules files. Instead, Copilot uses a *single* repository instruction file: .github/copilot-instructions.md  . This Markdown file sits in your project and contains any guidance or preferences you want Copilot to follow (coding style, frameworks, naming conventions, etc.). Copilot will detect this file and prepend its contents as hidden context to influence its suggestions . Essentially, it’s one file to cover all your “rules” for that repo (as opposed to many separate rule files in Cursor/Windsurf). A GitHub docs page confirms this is the intended way to give Copilot repository-specific guidance  . However, having only one file can be limiting if you have numerous or modular rules.

*(**Note:** GitHub has been evolving Copilot’s capabilities – recent updates in 2025 introduced support for multiple .instructions.md files in a .github/instructions/ folder for the new Copilot “agent” mode . But for most users and standard Copilot Chat, you’re still effectively working with the single copilot-instructions.md file.)*

## **Workarounds and Approaches Users Have Found**

Despite Copilot lacking a native multi-file rules system, developers have come up with ways to **mimic or supplement** what Cursor/Windsurf can do:

- **Leverage the .github/copilot-instructions.md File:** The simplest “workaround” is to fully utilize the one instructions file that Copilot *does* support. Teams will consolidate all their guidelines into that markdown. For example, one Reddit user discovered this feature and said it *“helped me steer the LLM toward more modern coding standards and practices”* by injecting up-to-date best-practice rules . They compiled general guidelines (security practices, code style, etc.) into the file, and Copilot then produced code following those conventions more closely. In other words, even though you can’t have multiple files, you can write a **very comprehensive** copilot-instructions.md covering all your “rules.” Copilot will reference it for every suggestion in that repo .
- **Mirror the Cursor/Windsurf Rules in Copilot:** Many developers maintain the *same content* across all three tools so that regardless of using Cursor, Windsurf, or VS Code+Copilot, the AI gets identical guidance. A blog post by a QA engineer demonstrates dropping one markdown rules file into each environment’s expected location: e.g. my-rules.mdc in .cursor/rules/, rules.md in .windsurf/rules/, **and** the same text in .github/copilot-instructions.md for VS Code . This way, the project’s best practices (say, how to structure Serenity BDD tests, naming conventions, etc.) are consistently applied by the AI everywhere. *“GitHub Copilot will automatically detect this file and prepend its contents as instructions… ensuring anyone working on the repo in VS Code gets the same guidance,”* notes the article . In practice, you’d take whatever “rules” you have (even if originally split into multiple files for Cursor) and paste/merge them into Copilot’s single instructions file.
- **Using Symlinks or Common Files:** Some teams keep a *central repository of prompts/rules* and then link or copy them into each tool’s location. For example, one developer shared that they put all rule files in a .prompts/ folder, then created symlinks: .cursor/rules -> ../.prompts and .windsurf/rules -> ../.prompts (so both IDEs read from the same files). For Copilot, they could only symlink one file (e.g. link .prompts/common.md to .github/copilot-instructions.md) due to Copilot’s single-file limitation . This workaround ensures no matter which IDE a team member uses, they’re pulling from the same set of rules. It’s a bit hacky (and requires everyone to include the file in their repo), but it **aligns Copilot with Cursor/Windsurf** as much as possible.
- **Custom Tools (“One File to Rule Them All”):** The community has also built utilities to streamline this cross-IDE consistency. For instance, an open-source tool called **“Ruler”** will take a master rules config and output it to *all* the necessary files – generating a .cursor/rules/your_rules.mdc, a .windsurf/rules/your_rules.md, **and** a .github/copilot-instructions.md automatically . This ensures every AI assistant gets the same instructions without manual copy-paste. Similarly, the *“knowhub”* tool was introduced to help share AI assistant rules across repositories; you define a central source (local folder or URL) for files like .cursor/rules or .windsurfrules or copilot-instructions.md, and it syncs them into each repo so they stay up to date . These tools address the pain of maintaining parallel rule files – effectively a more automated workaround.
- **Writing Effective Instructions:** Several blog posts and Reddit discussions focus on *how* to write the Copilot instructions file so that it compensates for Copilot’s lack of built-in rule management. The key tips include: keep the language natural and clear (it’s essentially a system prompt), cover your specific frameworks and coding style, and don’t overload it with fluff. For example, developers using BDD frameworks will add notes like *“Use Serenity Screenplay pattern for steps – prefer tasks over raw WebDriver calls”* or *“Follow Given/When/Then structure in test method generation”*. By explicitly stating these in the copilot-instructions.md, Copilot’s suggestions are more likely to align with those patterns. GitHub’s own guidance suggests using this file to specify things like *“we use tabs, not spaces” or project architecture notes, which Copilot will then invisibly factor into its outputs .* Some users even have Copilot (or ChatGPT) *help draft the instructions file* – e.g. prompting the AI *“Given my Cursor rules X, Y, Z, help me write an equivalent Copilot instructions file”*. This can jump-start the process of creating a good rules file for Copilot .
- **Community Examples and Content:** Many in the community have shared success stories and tutorials for these workarounds. The Checkly team (monitoring service) provides an example: they prepared an AI rules markdown for their API, and advise users to **download it into .github/copilot-instructions.md** for Copilot, or into .cursor/rules/… for Cursor, etc., to “teach” the AI about using their API in code . Tech bloggers on YouTube also demonstrate adding a Copilot instructions file to “teach Copilot your standards” (for instance, ensuring a certain code format or library usage) . In short, the developer community is actively exchanging tips on how to bend Copilot to follow custom rules, even if it’s not as straightforward as in Cursor or Windsurf.

## **Applying This to Your Serenity BDD/Selenium Project**

In a test automation project using Serenity BDD with Selenium (Java, Gradle, etc.), these approaches can be especially valuable. You likely have specific **patterns** (Screenplay tasks, page objects, BDD style scenarios) that you want the AI to follow. By creating a robust copilot-instructions.md in your repo, you can instruct Copilot to, for example, *“always use Serenity’s @Steps and @Narrative annotations,”* or *“prefer the Ensure.that(...) style for assertions rather than JUnit asserts,”* etc. Whenever you or teammates invoke Copilot in VS Code, it will see those Serenity-specific rules and (ideally) produce code that fits into your BDD framework. This is essentially a manual workaround to get Copilot on par with Cursor’s rules feature for your use case.

As a concrete step, you might do the following for consistency: create a **single source of truth** for your testing guidelines (e.g. a Markdown file listing all coding conventions, examples of the preferred Serenity page object structure, etc.), then use it everywhere. Put it in .cursor/rules/ for anyone using Cursor, in .windsurf/rules/ for Windsurf, and copy that content into .github/copilot-instructions.md for VS Code with Copilot  . This way, no matter which AI coding assistant a team member uses, the assistant will be “aware” of Serenity BDD and how tests should be written.

In summary, while GitHub Copilot doesn’t natively support multiple rule files like Cursor and Windsurf do, the developer community has **found workarounds**. Using the repository instructions file as a catch-all for rules is the primary solution, and it has been shown to work well for guiding Copilot’s behavior . For more advanced setups, people are linking files or using tools to synchronize rules across editors. By adopting these techniques, teams have successfully gotten Copilot to honor their coding standards and framework-specific practices – effectively **bridging the gap** until Copilot hopefully gains first-class support for multi-file rules in the future .
