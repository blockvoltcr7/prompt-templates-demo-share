Got it 👍 — you’re talking about the **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** file that GitHub recently introduced, right? It’s a configuration file that sits in your repo and provides **high-level guidance** to GitHub Copilot so that it can generate code more aligned with your project’s conventions and goals.

Here’s a breakdown:

---

## 📌 What is the `copilot-instructions.md` file?

* A Markdown file placed in the root of your repo (usually at `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
* It acts like a **“system prompt”** for Copilot across your whole repo.
* Helps Copilot understand:

  * Coding style (naming conventions, patterns, formatting).
  * Frameworks, libraries, or project-specific details.
  * Things to avoid (bad practices, deprecated APIs, etc.).
  * Domain-specific context (e.g., if you’re writing test automation, microservices, or AI agent orchestration).

---

## ⚙️ How Copilot Uses It

* When you open the repo in VSCode with Copilot enabled:

  * Copilot automatically reads the instructions.
  * It uses them to bias suggestions and completions.
* It’s not strict — Copilot won’t **enforce rules** but it will try to **align with your guidance**.
* Works **alongside** `.editorconfig`, Prettier, ESLint, etc. — but is higher-level and semantic.

## 🛠 Example `copilot-instructions.md`

```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
This is a FastAPI + Supabase backend for an AI agent system.
We follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns.

## Code Style
- Use Python 3.12 typing (`list[str]` instead of `List[str]`).
- Follow PEP8 and black formatting.
- Use descriptive variable names, no abbreviations.

## Patterns
- API routes must return Pydantic models.
- Use async/await for all database calls.
- Always write unit tests with pytest when introducing new functions.

## Avoid
- Do not use synchronous I/O.
- Do not use global variables.
- Do not use print() for logging (use `structlog`).

## Testing
- Place all tests inside `/tests`.
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests.
```

## 🚀 Benefits

* Keeps **new contributors** aligned automatically.
* Reduces “Copilot drift” into generic code.
* Saves you from constantly correcting Copilot suggestions.
* Works like **AI-powered documentation** for your repo.

👉 Do you want me to draft a **starter `copilot-instructions.md`** tailored to one of your projects (say your LangGraph sales agent repo, RFLKT app, or SSI Automations backend)? That way, you can drop it into VSCode and see Copilot adapt.
