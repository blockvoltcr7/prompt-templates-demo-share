# QA Test Automation Constitution

**Purpose**: This constitution defines the non-negotiable principles and best practices for test automation within this project.

---

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Tests are designed BEFORE implementation begins.**

- Test plans created from story analysis
- Gherkin scenarios written before step definitions
- Test automation code follows BDD scenarios
- No "testing after the fact" - tests guide implementation

**Rationale**: Test-first ensures comprehensive coverage and prevents gaps.

---

### II. BDD as Communication Protocol

**Gherkin scenarios are the contract between business and QA.**

- Scenarios must be business-readable (non-technical language)
- Given/When/Then structure strictly enforced
- Scenarios serve as living documentation
- Business stakeholders can understand test coverage

**Rationale**: BDD bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

---

### III. Test Independence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Every test must run in isolation and in any order.**

- No test depends on another test's state
- Each test sets up its own preconditions
- Tests clean up after themselves
- Parallel execution must be possible

**Rationale**: Test interdependencies create fragile, unmaintainable test suites.

---

### IV. Page Object Model for UI Tests

**UI interactions encapsulated in page objects.**

- No direct WebDriver calls in step definitions
- Page objects represent pages/components
- Page objects contain locators and interactions
- Step definitions delegate to page objects

**Rationale**: Separation of concerns and reusability.

---

### V. API Client Pattern for API Tests

**API interactions encapsulated in client classes.**

- No direct RestAssured calls in step definitions
- API clients represent endpoints/resources
- Clients contain request building and response parsing
- Step definitions delegate to API clients

**Rationale**: Centralized API interaction logic and maintainability.

---

### VI. Test Data Management

**Test data is managed systematically, never hardcoded.**

- Use test data generators for dynamic data
- Use data files for complex datasets
- Use builder pattern for test objects
- Clean up test data after tests

**Rationale**: Predictable, maintainable test data.

---

### VII. Explicit Error Handling

**Error scenarios are as important as happy paths.**

- Negative scenarios documented in test plan
- Validation scenarios included
- Error messages verified
- System state consistency checked

**Rationale**: Production systems fail - tests must verify failure handling.

---

### VIII. Test Pyramid Adherence

**Appropriate test level for each scenario.**

- Unit tests: Fast, isolated, many
- API tests: Medium speed, integration, moderate
- UI tests: Slower, end-to-end, fewer
- Avoid testing everything through UI

**Rationale**: Fast feedback, maintainable test suites.

---

### IX. Tag-Based Organization

**Tests organized with meaningful tags.**

- Priority tags: @P0, @P1, @P2, @P3
- Type tags: @ui, @api, @integration, @e2e
- Suite tags: @smoke, @regression, @sanity
- Category tags: @positive, @negative, @validation
- Story tags: @STORY-KEY

**Rationale**: Flexible test execution and reporting.

---

### X. CI/CD Integration

**Tests run automatically in CI/CD pipeline.**

- Smoke tests on every commit
- Regression tests on every PR
- Nightly full regression
- Test results published and visible

**Rationale**: Continuous quality feedback.

---

## Quality Standards

### Test Code Quality

- Same standards as production code
- Code reviews required
- DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Clean code practices
- Meaningful names and comments

### Test Execution

- Tests must be deterministic (no randomness without seed)
- No flaky tests tolerated (fix or remove)
- Tests must complete in reasonable time
- Clear pass/fail criteria

### Test Maintenance

- Update tests when requirements change
- Remove obsolete tests
- Refactor duplicated code
- Monitor test execution trends

---

## Test Automation Framework Standards

### Technology Stack (for Java/Serenity projects)

- **Language**: Java 11+
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle
- **BDD Framework**: Cucumber
- **Automation Framework**: Serenity BDD
- **UI Automation**: Selenium WebDriver
- **API Automation**: RestAssured
- **Assertions**: AssertJ or Hamcrest

└── runners/             # Test runners
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Packages**: lowercase, descriptive
- **Classes**: PascalCase, descriptive
- **Methods**: camelCase, descriptive (Given/When/Then match Gherkin)
- **Variables**: camelCase, meaningful
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

---

## Test Design Principles

### Gherkin Scenario Design

- **One scenario, one purpose**: Test one thing
- **Independent scenarios**: No order dependencies
- **Descriptive names**: Scenario name explains what is tested
- **Business language**: Avoid technical jargon
- **Use Background**: For common preconditions
- **Use Scenario Outline**: For data-driven tests

### Step Definition Design

- **Thin step definitions**: Delegate to page objects or APIs
- **Reusable steps**: Write generic steps when possible
- **Clear parameters**: Use descriptive parameter names
- **No business logic**: Keep logic in page objects/API clients

### Page Object Design

- **One page object per page/component**
- **Public methods for actions**: clickLogin(), enterUsername()
- **Private locators**: Encapsulated WebElement finding
- **Return values**: For assertions and chaining
- **Wait for elements**: Use explicit waits, avoid sleeps

### API Client Design

- **One client per resource/endpoint**
- **Builder pattern for requests**: Fluent API
- **Response parsing**: Extract common patterns
- **Verification methods**: assertUserCreated(), etc.

---

## Non-Functional Testing Standards

### Performance Testing

- Response time targets defined in test plan
- Load testing for critical paths
- Performance degradation alerts

### Security Testing

- Authentication/authorization scenarios
- Input validation and sanitization

## Governance

### Constitution Authority

- This constitution supersedes all other testing practices
- Changes require documentation, approval, and team agreement
- All test code reviews verify constitutional compliance

### Code Quality Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Mandatory Review Before Commit**:
- `/review-code` command must be run after `/implement-tests`
- All CRITICAL violations must be fixed before Git commit
- HIGH violations should be fixed or documented
- MEDIUM/LOW violations can be deferred with justification

**Automated Enforcement**:
- Code quality report generated for every implementation
- Constitutional principles automatically validated
- Clean code principles systematically checked
- Severity-based gate decision (PASS/FAIL)

**Review Scope**:
- Function size and complexity
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Page Object Model compliance (UI tests)
- API Client Pattern compliance (API tests)
- Test independence
- Test data management
- Code duplication (DRY)
- Flaky test patterns

**Remediation Options**:
- Auto-fix: AI applies corrections automatically
- Manual fix: Developer applies guided corrections
- Accept: Document justification for exception

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Constitution compliance percentage
- Average function size
- DRY violations count
- Code quality score trend

### Violation Handling

- Constitutional violations must be justified in writing
- Temporary violations require remediation plan
- Repeated violations require process improvement
- Code quality report stored with test artifacts for audit trail

### Amendment Process

1. Propose change with rationale
2. Team review and discussion
3. Approval by QA Lead and Engineering Manager
4. Update constitution with version bump
5. Communicate to all team members

## Test Automation Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ Record-and-Playback Tests
- **Problem**: Brittle, unmaintainable
- **Solution**: Write code-based tests with page objects

### ❌ Sleeping Instead of Waiting
- **Problem**: Flaky tests, slow execution
- **Solution**: Use explicit waits for elements

### ❌ Hardcoded Test Data
- **Problem**: Maintenance nightmare, conflicts
- **Solution**: Use test data generators and builders

### ❌ Testing Everything Through UI
- **Problem**: Slow, expensive, fragile
- **Solution**: Test APIs directly when possible

### ❌ Copy-Paste Step Definitions
- **Problem**: Code duplication
- **Solution**: Write reusable, parameterized steps

### ❌ Ignoring Flaky Tests
- **Problem**: Loss of confidence in test suite
- **Solution**: Fix root cause or remove test

### ❌ No Code Reviews for Tests
- **Problem**: Technical debt, poor quality
- **Solution**: Review test code like production code

### ❌ Skipping Negative Scenarios
