# QA/SDET Test Automation Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Strategy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test planning precedes test automation development. Every Jira story/task must have:
- Comprehensive test plan document created first
- Test scenarios defined in Gherkin BDD format
- Test automation strategy documented before coding
- Acceptance criteria validated with stakeholders

### II. BDD-Driven Development
All test automation follows Behavior-Driven Development principles:
- Features written in Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then)
- Scenarios must be business-readable and stakeholder-approved
- Step definitions are reusable across multiple scenarios
- Feature files serve as living documentation

### III. Framework-Agnostic Design
Test automation must be maintainable and scalable:
- Page Object Model (POM) or similar patterns mandatory
- Clear separation of test data, test logic, and test execution
- Support for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Configurable test execution (smoke, regression, full suite)

### IV. Traceability & Documentation
Every test must maintain clear traceability:
- Link to original Jira story/requirement
- Test scenarios mapped to acceptance criteria
- Test results linked to specific builds/releases
- Defect tracking integration

### V. Quality Gates & Reporting
Comprehensive test reporting and quality metrics:
- Automated test execution reports (HTML, JSON, XML)
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Real-time test result dashboards
- Failed test investigation and root cause analysis

## Test Automation Standards

### Framework Requirements
- **Java + Serenity Cucumber BDD** (primary)
- **REST Assured** for API testing
- **Selenium WebDriver** for UI automation
- **TestNG/JUnit** for test execution management
- **Maven/Gradle** for dependency management

### Code Quality Standards
- Test code follows same quality standards as production code
- Code reviews mandatory for all test automation changes
- 90%+ test pass rate maintained in CI/CD pipeline
- No hardcoded test data - externalized in config files

### Environment Management
- Tests must run reliably across all target environments
- Database state management and cleanup
- Test data management strategy
- Mock services for external dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Test Planning Phase
1. Analyze Jira story/task requirements
2. Create comprehensive test plan document
3. Define test scenarios in Gherkin BDD format
4. Review with stakeholders and development team
5. Get approval before automation development

### Test Automation Phase
1. Create/update feature files in Gherkin
2. Implement step definitions
3. Develop page objects/API wrappers
4. Execute tests locally and validate
5. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

### Quality Assurance Phase
1. Code review for test automation changes
2. Validate test execution in target environments
3. Update test documentation and reports
4. Monitor test stability and performance

## Governance

### Review Process
- All test automation code requires peer review
- Test plans require stakeholder sign-off
- Failed tests must be investigated within 24 hours
- Test automation debt tracked and prioritized

### Compliance Requirements
- Constitution supersedes all other testing practices
- All test automation must follow established patterns
- Exceptions require documentation and approval
- Regular framework updates and maintenance
