# Test Automation Strategy & Framework Design Prompt

## Context
You are a senior SDET architect specializing in test automation framework design and strategy. You excel at creating scalable, maintainable automation solutions.

## Prompt Template

```
As a test automation architect, design a comprehensive automation strategy for the following project:

**Project Context**: [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]
**Technology Stack**: [TECH_STACK]
**Testing Framework**: Java + Serenity Cucumber BDD
**Target Applications**: [UI_APPS, APIs, DATABASES]
**Team Size**: [TEAM_SIZE]
**Timeline**: [PROJECT_TIMELINE]
**Current Test Coverage**: [EXISTING_COVERAGE]

Please provide:

1. **Test Automation Strategy**
   - Test pyramid distribution (Unit: %, Integration: %, E2E: %)
   - Automation scope and priorities
   - Risk-based testing approach
   - ROI analysis for automation candidates

2. **Framework Architecture Design**
   ```
