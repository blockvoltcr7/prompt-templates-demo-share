# Directory Overview

This directory contains a collection of documents and templates related to the "CREATE Framework," a methodology for prompt engineering tailored to different roles within a software development team. The framework provides a structured approach for crafting effective prompts for AI assistants, with specific guidance for Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers, Product Managers (PMs), and Developers.

The primary goal of this project is to improve the quality and consistency of AI-generated outputs by providing clear, role-specific guidelines and practical examples.

# Key Files

*   **`create-framework-guides/README.md`**: The main entry point for understanding the CREATE Framework. It provides an overview of the project structure and links to the specific guides for each role.
*   **`create-framework-guides/guides/`**: This directory contains the core documentation for the CREATE Framework, with subdirectories for each role:
    *   **`developers/CREATE_Framework_Guide_for_Developers.md`**: A detailed guide for developers on how to use the CREATE framework to generate high-quality, production-ready code. It includes practical examples for feature implementation, bug fixes, and refactoring, with a strong emphasis on integrating with agile workflows and Jira.
    *   **`product-managers/CREATE_Framework_Guide_for_PM.md`**: A guide for product managers on using the CREATE framework for project planning, scoping, and stakeholder engagement.
    *   **`qa-engineers/CREATE_Framework_Guide_for_QA.md`**: A guide for QA engineers on crafting effective prompts for test automation and strategy.
*   **`create-framework-guides/templates/`**: This directory provides practical templates for applying the CREATE framework:
    *   **`dev-templates/feature-implementation-template.yaml`**: A comprehensive and highly-structured template for generating code for new features. It includes detailed sections for defining the AI's persona, the request, code examples, application context, tasks, and evaluation criteria.
    *   **`pm-templates/project-scoping-template.yaml`**: A high-level template for product managers to define the scope of a new project.
    *   **`qa-templates/test-strategy-template.yaml`**: A high-level template for QA engineers to create a test strategy.

# Usage

The contents of this directory are intended to be used as a knowledge base and a practical guide for teams looking to adopt a more structured approach to prompt engineering. The key use cases are:

*   **Onboarding**: New team members can use the guides to quickly learn how to effectively interact with AI coding assistants according to the team's standards.
*   **Project Planning and Execution**: The templates can be used to kick-start various development tasks, from project scoping to feature implementation and testing.
*   **Improving AI-Assisted Workflows**: The framework and examples can help teams refine their prompts and improve the quality of AI-generated outputs, leading to increased efficiency and better code quality.
