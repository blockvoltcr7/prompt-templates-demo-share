# CREATE Framework Overview

## Introduction

The CREATE framework is a structured approach designed to enhance the effectiveness of project planning and scoping for product managers and product owners. It provides a clear methodology for defining project goals, engaging stakeholders, and prioritizing features, ensuring that projects are aligned with business objectives and user needs.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the CREATE framework is to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of project requirements and to streamline the decision-making process. By utilizing this framework, product managers can ensure that their projects are well-defined, actionable, and strategically aligned.

## Framework Components

The CREATE framework consists of several key components that guide product managers through the planning and scoping process:

1. **C - Character**: Define the role and expertise of the stakeholders involved in the project. This includes understanding who will be impacted by the project and who will contribute to its success.

2. **R - Request**: Clearly articulate the specific objectives of the project. This involves stating what the project aims to achieve and the problems it seeks to solve.

3. **E - Examples**: Provide relevant scenarios or case studies that illustrate similar projects or features. This helps in contextualizing the project and understanding potential challenges and solutions.

4. **A - Application**: Describe the specific context in which the project will be implemented. This includes details about the target audience, market conditions, and any relevant technical or business constraints.

5. **T - Task**: Specify the exact tasks and deliverables required to achieve the project objectives. This includes outlining the scope of work and identifying key milestones.

6. **E - Evaluation**: Establish criteria for measuring the success of the project. This involves defining what success looks like and how it will be assessed throughout the project lifecycle.

## Benefits

By adopting the CREATE framework, product managers can expect several benefits:

- **Clarity**: Provides a clear structure for project planning, reducing ambiguity and ensuring all stakeholders are aligned.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the scoping process, allowing for quicker decision-making and prioritization.
- **Alignment**: Ensures that projects are aligned with business goals and user needs, increasing the likelihood of project success.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates better communication and collaboration among stakeholders, fostering a shared understanding of project objectives.

## Conclusion
