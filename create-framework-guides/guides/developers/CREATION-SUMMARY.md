## How Developers Can Use This

### For Sprint Planning
1. Review Jira stories
2. Identify complex tasks
3. Create CREATE prompts upfront
4. Share with team for alignment
5. Reference during implementation

### During Development
1. Pick appropriate template
2. Fill in project-specific details
3. Generate code with AI assistant
4. Review and customize output
5. Add tests and documentation
6. Commit with Jira reference

### For Bug Fixes
1. Use bug-fix template
2. Include monitoring data
3. Focus on root cause
4. Add regression tests
5. Document in post-mortem

### For Code Reviews
1. Check if CREATE prompt was used
2. Verify all evaluation criteria met
3. Ensure tests pass
4. Validate documentation
5. Approve with confidence
