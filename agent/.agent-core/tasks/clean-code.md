**Function Design Principles:**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle:**
   - Each function should do one thing well
   - Extract multiple responsibilities into separate functions
   - Use descriptive function names
   - Keep functions focused and cohesive

2. **Function Size Optimization:**
   - Keep functions small (typically 20 lines or less)
   - Extract complex logic into separate functions
   - Use function composition for complex operations
   - Avoid deeply nested code structures

3. **Parameter Management:**
   - Minimize number of parameters (ideally 3 or fewer)
   - Use parameter objects for related parameters
   - Avoid boolean parameters (use enums or separate methods)
   - Implement default parameters where appropriate

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Use exceptions for exceptional conditions
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Clean up resources properly
   - Avoid silent failures

**Refactoring Techniques:**
- Extract Method for complex code blocks
- Introduce Parameter Object for multiple parameters
