     language: "Java"
     build_tool: "Maven/Gradle"
     test_runner: "JUnit 5"
     reporting: "Serenity Reports"
   ```

2. **Test Architecture Design:**

### Step 3: Test Pyramid Strategy
**Objective:** Define optimal test distribution across different levels

**Test Level Distribution:**
```yaml
test_levels:
  unit_tests:
    percentage: "60-70%"
    tools: ["JUnit 5", "Mockito"]
    responsibility: "Development Team"
    
  integration_tests:
    percentage: "20-25%"
    tools: ["Serenity BDD", "TestContainers"]
    responsibility: "Development Team + QA"
    
  api_tests:
    percentage: "15-20%"
    tools: ["Serenity REST", "RestAssured"]
    responsibility: "QA Team"
    
  ui_tests:
    percentage: "5-10%"
    tools: ["Serenity WebDriver", "Selenium"]
    responsibility: "QA Team"
    
  e2e_tests:
    percentage: "3-5%"
    tools: ["Serenity BDD + Cucumber"]
    responsibility: "QA Team"
```

**Strategy Rationale:**
- Fast feedback from unit tests
- API tests for business logic validation
- UI tests for critical user journeys
- E2E tests for complete business scenarios
- Integration tests for system boundaries

**Implementation Approach:**
- Start with API automation (highest ROI)

### Step 4: BDD Implementation Strategy
**Objective:** Define comprehensive BDD approach with Cucumber

**BDD Strategy Components:**
1. **Feature File Organization:**
   ```

   ├── authentication/
   │   ├── login.feature
   │   └── password_reset.feature
   ├── user_management/
   │   ├── user_creation.feature
   │   └── user_profile.feature
   └── reporting/
       ├── dashboard.feature
       └── analytics.feature
   ```

2. **Gherkin Writing Standards:**
   - Use Given-When-Then format consistently
   - Write from user perspective
   - Keep scenarios focused and independent
   - Use scenario outlines for data-driven tests
   - Implement background for common setup

3. **Step Definition Strategy:**
   - Organize by domain/feature areas
   - Use Page Objects within step definitions
   - Implement reusable step definitions
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Use dependency injection for shared state

**BDD Best Practices:**
- Living documentation approach
- Collaboration between BA, Dev, and QA
