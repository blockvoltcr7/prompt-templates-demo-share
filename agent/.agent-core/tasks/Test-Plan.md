### Step 5: Test Case Design and Scenario Planning
**Objective:** Design comprehensive test scenarios using BDD approach

**BDD Feature Design:**
```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]
  As a [user type]
  I want [capability]  
  So that [business value]

Background: [Common setup for all scenarios]
  Given [common preconditions]

Scenario: [Test Scenario Name]
  Given [precondition]
  When [action]
  Then [expected result]

Scenario Outline: [Parameterized Test Scenario]
  Given [precondition with <parameter>]
  When [action with <parameter>]
  Then [expected result with <parameter>]
  
  Examples:
    | parameter | expected_result |
    | value1    | result1         |
    | value2    | result2         |
```

**Test Case Categories:**
- **Happy Path Scenarios:** Normal user workflows
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Alternative valid paths
- **Error Scenarios:** Invalid inputs and error conditions
- **Boundary Testing:** Edge cases and limits
- **Integration Scenarios:** Cross-system interactions

**Coverage Planning:**
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Test coverage metrics
- Risk-based coverage prioritization
- Regression test identification

**Reference Template:** Use `Test-Plan-template.md` sections:
- Test Cases
- Test Coverage
