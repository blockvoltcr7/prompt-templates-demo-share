### **🔹 Your Task:**

Use GitHub Copilot agent mode tools to perform comprehensive pull request analysis and provide detailed review feedback.

---

### **🔹 Required Agent Mode Tools:**

Utilize these specific GitHub Copilot agent mode tools for comprehensive analysis:

**Core Analysis Tools**:

- ✅ **`changes`**: Analyze all file diffs and modifications in the PR
- ✅ **`codebase`**: Search relevant file chunks and symbols for context
- ✅ **`usages`**: Find references and usages of modified symbols/functions
- ✅ **`search`**: Search workspace for related patterns and implementations
- ✅ **`findTestFiles`**: Locate corresponding test files for modified code
- ✅ **`problems`**: Check for syntax errors and code issues

---

### **🔹 Required Analysis Areas:**

**1. Requirement Alignment Analysis**:

- Use **`changes`** and **`codebase`** to verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Cross-reference story requirements with actual code changes
- Identify missing functionality or incomplete implementations

**2. Code Quality Assessment**:

- Use **`usages`** to analyze impact of modified functions/classes
- Use **`search`** to find similar patterns and ensure consistency
- Use **`problems`** to identify syntax errors, warnings, or issues
- Check for code smells, anti-patterns, and maintainability concerns

**3. Security Risk Analysis**:

- Use **`codebase`** to search for potential security vulnerabilities
- Check for SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass risks, or any critical risks identified
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Review access control and authorization logic

**4. Performance Risk Assessment**:

- Use **`usages`** to identify performance-critical code paths
- Check for N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms, memory leaks
- Analyze database query patterns and caching strategies
- Review resource usage and scalability implications

**5. Integration Impact Analysis**:

- Use **`search`** and **`usages`** to find all dependent code
- Identify breaking changes to APIs or data contracts
- Check integration points with external services
- Validate backward compatibility requirements

**6. Test Coverage Validation**:

- Use **`findTestFiles`** to locate relevant test files
- Verify new functionality has corresponding tests
- Identify missing edge cases and negative scenarios
