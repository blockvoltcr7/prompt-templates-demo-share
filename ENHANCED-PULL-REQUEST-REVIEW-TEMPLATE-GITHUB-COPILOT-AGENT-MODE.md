### **🔹 Your Task:**

Use GitHub Copilot agent mode tools to perform comprehensive pull request analysis and provide detailed review feedback.

---

### **🔹 Required Agent Mode Tools:**

Utilize these specific GitHub Copilot agent mode tools for comprehensive analysis:

**Core Analysis Tools**:

- ✅ **`Git Changes`**: Get diffs of changed files in the PR
- ✅ **`Codebase`**: Reference relevant file chunks, symbols, and other information in your code
- ✅ **`Find Usages`**: Find references, definitions, and other usages of modified symbols/functions
- ✅ **`Search View Results`**: Search workspace for related patterns and implementations
- ✅ **`Find Test Files`**: For source code files, find the files that contain the tests
- ✅ **`Get Problems`**: Check errors for particular files

**Additional Available Tools**:
- ✅ **`Test Failure`**: Includes information about the last unit test failure
- ✅ **`Search GitHub Repository`**: Search GitHub repository for relevant source code snippets

---

### **🔹 Required Analysis Areas:**

**1. Requirement Alignment Analysis**:

- Use **`Git Changes`** and **`Codebase`** to verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Cross-reference story requirements with actual code changes
- Identify missing functionality or incomplete implementations

**2. Code Quality Assessment**:

- Use **`Find Usages`** to analyze impact of modified functions/classes
- Use **`Search View Results`** to find similar patterns and ensure consistency
- Use **`Get Problems`** to identify syntax errors, warnings, or issues
- Check for code smells, anti-patterns, and maintainability concerns

**3. Security Risk Analysis**:

- Use **`Codebase`** to search for potential security vulnerabilities
- Check for SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass risks, or any critical risks identified
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Review access control and authorization logic

**4. Performance Risk Assessment**:

- Use **`Find Usages`** to identify performance-critical code paths
- Check for N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms, memory leaks
- Analyze database query patterns and caching strategies
- Review resource usage and scalability implications

**5. Integration Impact Analysis**:

- Use **`Search View Results`** and **`Find Usages`** to find all dependent code
- Identify breaking changes to APIs or data contracts
- Check integration points with external services
- Validate backward compatibility requirements

**6. Test Coverage Validation**:

- Use **`Find Test Files`** to locate relevant test files for modified code
- Use **`Test Failure`** to check for any existing test issues
- Verify new functionality has corresponding tests
- Identify missing edge cases and negative scenarios

### **🔹 Agent Mode Workflow:**

**Recommended Execution Sequence**:

1. **Discovery Phase**: 
   - Use `Git Changes` to identify all modified files and understand the scope of changes
   - Use `Codebase` to understand broader context and architecture

2. **Analysis Phase**: 
   - Use `Find Usages` and `Search View Results` to find impact on related code
   - Use `Find Test Files` for test coverage analysis
   - Focus analysis on files identified in Discovery Phase

3. **Validation Phase**: 
   - Use `Get Problems` to identify immediate issues in changed files
   - Use `Test Failure` to check for any existing test issues
   - Validate that analysis covers all modified areas

4. **Documentation Phase**: 
   - Compile comprehensive findings with tool evidence
   - Categorize issues by priority and provide actionable recommendations
