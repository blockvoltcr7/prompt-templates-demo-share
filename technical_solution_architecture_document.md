### **🔹 Role:**

You are acting as a **Senior Solution Architect and Lead Developer**, responsible for preparing **technical documentation and demo-ready artifacts** for both engineering teams and non-technical stakeholders.

---

### **🔹 Context:**

We are implementing a new feature within the system:

**[Insert a brief, clear summary of the feature—what it does and why it’s important]**

Describe how the new functionality interacts with existing logic.

📝 *Example: “After [existing process], we now want to add [new behavior or output].”*

---

### **🔹 Your Task:**

Provide a complete and accessible explanation of the current system and how the new feature integrates into it.

---

### **🔹 Required Research Areas:**

Conduct deep, function-level analysis in the following parts of the codebase:

- [insert relevant path or module 1]
- [insert relevant path or module 2]
- [insert relevant path or module 3]

(Adjust based on architecture)

---

### **🔹 Deliverables:**

Create and include the following artifacts as part of your output:

- ✅ **Flow Diagrams**: End-to-end process for how the system behaves before and after the feature integration
- ✅ **Component Interaction Maps**: How modules work together to enable the feature
- ✅ **Function-Level Summaries**: Highlight the responsibilities of key functions/classes
- ✅ **Integration Sequence**: Define where the new logic fits in the execution chain
- ✅ **Visual Architecture Overview**: Optional system map for architecture review
- ✅ **Stakeholder Demo Summary**: Plain-language explanation of the new feature’s purpose and benefits

---

### **🔹 Output Goals:**

Ensure your output is:

- 🧩 **Technically accurate** and aligned with current implementation
- 🎯 **Stakeholder-friendly** and easy to visualize in a live demo
- 🔁 **Reusable and maintainable** for future updates
- 📽️ **Demo-Ready**: supports storytelling for internal/external presentations

---

### **🔹 Optional Add-ons (if needed):**

- 🗂️ Add code references or PR links
- 🗣️ Include user-facing language or captions that will appear in the UI
- 🧪 Suggest test cases or edge cases that need coverage
- 🎬 Request a simulation file or prototype (HTML) for stakeholder walkthroughs

Would you like this saved as a .md, .txt, or template file for Notion/Confluence/Docs export? I can format that next.
