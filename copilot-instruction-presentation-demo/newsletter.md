# Boost Your GitHub Copilot with Custom Project Instructions

Generic AI suggestions that don't match your project's patterns lead to inconsistent code, longer code reviews, and slower onboarding for new team members. Our new prompt template solves this by automatically analyzing your codebase and generating a custom `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file tailored to your repository's tech stack, architecture, and coding standards.

Early results show:
- 20-30% faster code reviews
- 50% faster onboarding
- Significantly improved Copilot suggestion quality

The template is now available on SharePoint: [SHAREPOINT_LINK].

Try it on your next project—it takes just 2-3 minutes to transform Copilot from a generic assistant into a project-aware expert.
